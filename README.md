# A Covid-19 data analysis
This repo demonstrates a data analysis project on covid-19, with data updated until 2021-10-13.
Still working on it.
There are analysis made through SQL as well as Python.
A Tableau Visualization can be found in here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/carlos6708/viz/covid_analysis-2021-10-13/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
This project was inspired in a series of videos from the youtube channel "Alex - The Analyst", which can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f).
